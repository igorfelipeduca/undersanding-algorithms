In this repository will be listed all of the lessons I did in order to learn more about algorithms and find new ways to improve my understanding about computing.

### About the challenge

The book itself recommends its readers to use [Python](https://python.org), because the examples listed on the books are all written in [Python](https://python.org).

In order to bring the book challenges to an another level, I am challenging myself to beat them while learning a new programming language: [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).
